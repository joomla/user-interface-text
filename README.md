###Abstract
* The official language of Joomla is en-GB and yet the actual strings we use have been created over 10 years mainly by people who are not native en-GB speakers. 
* We have no style guide to determine the correct usage of en-GB for example: capitalisation and punctuation.
* The primary aim is to create a single short document that will assist anyone writing new language strings for Joomla.
* A secondary aim is that this style guide can be used as a basis for translation teams
* Traditional rules of grammar do not always apply to the web. See [Break Grammar Rules on Websites for Clarity](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/break-grammar-rules/)

####Purpose
* Establish official style guidelines for writing en-GB strings.
* Ensure consistency throughout Joomla.
* Provide translation teams with an easy framework and guidelines to create their own style guides.	
* See [NNG on American vs British english for the web](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/american-vs-british-english-for-web/)

####Target audience
* Primary: Developers writing en-GB strings
* Secondary: Translation teams 

####Uses
* Primary: Basis for all en-GB strings
* Secondary: Assist non native en-GB developers writing language strings in en-GB
* Tertiary: Provide guidelines for translation teams
